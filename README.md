# Wikkipedia Viewer App

This is a javascript App for viewing wikkipedia articles. The user types a particular word into the text field and all the related articles are immediately fetched and displayed in the UI via the wikkipedia API. Some CSS3 animations was used to increase the user experience. All codes were written by me from the scratch.

## TOOLS USED

HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Wikkipedia API, Javascript/jQuery
